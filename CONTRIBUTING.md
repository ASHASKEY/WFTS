<h3 id="further-recommendations"><a name="further-recommendations" href="#further-recommendations"></a>Further Recommendations</h3>
<p>We recommend the following process for contributing great code to Wi-Fi Test Suite:</p>
<h5 id="4.1-diff-before-every-commit"><a name="4.1-diff-before-every-commit" href="#4.1-diff-before-every-commit"></a>4.1 Diff Before Every Commit</h5>
<pre><code>Get into the habit of running git diff or git diff --cached before every commit.
</code></pre><h5 id="4.2.-commits-should-be-granular"><a name="4.2.-commits-should-be-granular" href="#4.2.-commits-should-be-granular"></a>4.2. Commits Should Be Granular</h5>
<pre><code>You should keep each commit as granular as possible. For instance, do not check in 2 bug fixes in one commit -- separate them out into 2 commits. Any big change must be split into multiple commit as small feature
</code></pre><h5 id="4.3.-coding-style"><a name="4.3.-coding-style" href="#4.3.-coding-style"></a>4.3. Coding Style</h5>
<p>The Windows DUT is written in the C programming language.We use GNU coding style.</p>
<h5 id="4.4.-get-feedback-early-and-often"><a name="4.4.-get-feedback-early-and-often" href="#4.4.-get-feedback-early-and-often"></a>4.4. Get feedback early and often</h5>
<pre><code>- A draft about the proposal.
- An API review validates your initial approach.
- A design review validates your high-level architecture.
- A code review validates your implementation details.

<pre><code>- API docs
- Examples
- User guides
</code></pre><h5 id="4.6.-do-your-tests"><a name="4.6.-do-your-tests" href="#4.6.-do-your-tests"></a>4.6. Do your tests</h5>
<pre><code>- Unit
- Functional
- Performance
